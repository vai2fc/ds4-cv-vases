# Looking for Signal, Listening for Noise: Using a Convolutional Neural Network to Identify Musical Instruments in 4th c. BCE Apulian Vases

Welcome to the repo for my Nashville Software School Data Science Cohort 4 capstone project on identifying stringed instruments in 4th century BCE Apulian vase-painting.

### Why ancient pottery + computer vision?
At the heart of this project is the question of whether or not a computer can be trained to 'read' the rich and varied imagery ('iconography') on ancient Greek and South Italian pottery. As photographic and other visual archives digitize their vast collections, is there a place for computer vision algorithms to assist the stewards and curators of these materials in generating more informative and inclusive metadata?

This project sits squarely at the crossroads of my past work (my [dissertation](http://dx.doi.org/10.18130/V3RG67) on the representation of music and musicians in 4th c. BCE Apulian Red-Figure Vase-Painting and postdocs in data curation, research data management, and digital humanities) and my current professional interests (deep learning, explainable ML, and ethical AI). By blending my experience of doing hands-on, archival research at the [A.D. Trendall Research Centre for Ancient Mediterranean Studies](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/trendall) with my developing understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks for image recognition, I aim to explore the potential of computer vision in making archival collections not only more available, but also more *accessible*, online.

### What is in this repo?
This repo contains three folders: `macros`, `notebooks`, and `resources`. The `macros` folder contains a short macro to facilitate image labeling using [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The `resources` folder contains a `.yaml` file that explicitly states the versions of the primary packages used in this project. The `notebooks` folder contains notebooks for image pre-processing, data sampling, and model building, as well as a couple of notebooks specifically for live demonstration. Out of respect for the rights of the [A.D. Trendall Research Centre for Ancient Mediterranean Studies](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/trendall) to the images I worked with throughout this project, the `data` folder has not been shared (though the data structure may be inferred from the notebooks).

It's a WIP - check back for updates!
